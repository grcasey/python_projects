# Exploration of data for NYC flights in 2013 

## Description of the project:
The data are stored in MySQL database, which is created using Amazon RDS by Amazon Web Services (AWS).
The data represent publicly available dataset of NYC flights for 2013.
I access data using SQL queries embedded in python script to further conduct an exploratory analysis. 

## Connection to database:
First, database parameters should be stored in environment variables on bash.
Python development environment should be launched from Terminal window to pick up stored environment variables:

Example:
```
open -na Anaconda-Navigator
```

## How to run:
Run Python_codeAWS_RDS.py file.
